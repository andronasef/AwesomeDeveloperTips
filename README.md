## For All Pool

 - **EŸènjoy your accomplishments**, Recognising and celebrating success is a very powerful motivator for humans because it reinforces
   the meaning behind all that hard work and it shows appreciation for
   the achievements. This, in turn, boosts our self-esteem and it
   motivates us to take the next step towards achieving the next goal.
 
 -   **You must have mentor**, A good mentor inspires you, stretches you, connects you, develops your IQ, EQ and AQ, opens your mind and most importantly doesn't judge you. They provide a safe space to learn, experiment and ask questions, no matter how stupid your question may sound.

 - **Find a outlet**, If you work in the field of programming, you need a hobby that you go to from time to time. Find a hobby that you love and practice it in addition to learning programming so that you can complete your educational journey and work. The hobby is food for the mind and with it you will never feel bored and you will always be open and have the ability to receive new information and delve into In more experiences and get more and more experiences.
- **Lack of sleep kills you**, sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke and a result of the experiment indicated that sleep deprivation has a negative effect on the capacity of software developers by 50% to produce a software solution that meets given requirements.
